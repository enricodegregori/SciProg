    "* `blank.txt` - a blank text file. The code has nothing to stop it dividing by zero when it calculates mean word length.\n",
    "* `repeat.txt` - this repeats the first verse of the Edward Lear poem *The Jumblies* 68 times. The longest n-gram function only looks for n-grams 50 words or shorter, so fails to spot this and instead slices up the poem. There are a couple of ways to deal with this. One would be that if the code finds an n-gram of length 50, check to see if this is a substring of a longer one until no longer find n-grams. Alternatively, could start looking for n-grams of length 2 and increase until no more are found, then eliminate substrings.\n",

    "* Longest words and n-grams are both stored in dictionaries, so the in which these are printed will often vary between runs. Care should be taken when designing tests to account for this!\n",
    "* `short.txt` - Length of file is only 5 words, so when code prints out '10 longest words', it only actually prints out 5. This is a minor error, but nonetheless is not correct behaviour.\n",
    "* `nile.csv` - this is just a load of numbers, so results are pretty meaningless. Code should really check it's looking at an actual text file."
