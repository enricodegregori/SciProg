    "First of all, version control allows us to keep a comprehensive record of all changes made during a project. It keeps track of exactly what was edited, when this was done and who by. This is very useful if later down the line a change is made that breaks something, as it will make tracking down and pinpointing the line of code responsible for the bug much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control allows us to keep backups of previous versions of files. This is important if you ever need to recreate some data that was made using a previous version of the code, as you can easily 'rewind' the code back to the state it was then. For example, say you have submitted a paper to a journal. A few months later, you get a response from one of the reviewers asking you to replot one of your figures. However, in the meantime you have been working on your code and so in its current state you cannot recreate exactly the data in the original plot. If you have used version control, this will not be an issue as you can simply roll your code back to the version you used to create the original plot. Similarly, if you publish results produced using your code, you can point readers to the exact version of the code used to produce them, allowing them to run the code and reproduce the results themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "When making major changes to a code, it can often be a little scary as there is always a chance said changes could break everything. It may be tempting to make a separate version of your project by hand - `project_version_2` - however this can quickly get messy (eventually you will end up with folders full of different versions of your project). Version control offers a better solution, allowing you to create branches. The working version of the code can be preserved on the main master branch while you hack away at the code on some other branch. If you implement a change in one of the branches and it breaks everything, the other branches will remain unaffected, so you can easily revert back to a working version of the code. Branches are especially useful if you have other people using your code: there is always a working version of the code on the master branch for them to use, and any changes you make will not affect them until you merge your branch with the master branch."
